# 📚 Library

This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum**, where I created a simple **Library** application to manage a collection of books. The project allows users to add, remove, and view books, enhancing my understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and data management.

## 🌟 Features

- Add new books with title, author, and read status.
- Remove books from the library.
- View a list of all books added to the library.
- Toggle the read status of each book.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the library interface and book entries.
- **CSS**: For styling the library layout and book elements.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic for adding, removing, and managing books in the library.
